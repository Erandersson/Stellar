You are passing the game object as the parameter into the bullet class by
( public Bullet( double x, double y, Textures tex, Game game )) .
This basically allows the bullet class to have access to the variables and methods of the game class..
Isn't this a bad practice?

Create a world object to represent your game world and store your lists of entities in there.

You can have appropriate methods to add entities to the world and to retrieve the list.

Create a world object where the lists previously where and pass that instead of your entire game class.

It fits well with OOP paradigm and is really quite simple.ï»¿
